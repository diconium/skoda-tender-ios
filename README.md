# Architecture

* View is responsible for displaying the message to the user, such as printing it to the console.
* ViewModel handles any user input or interactions and update the Model and View as needed.
* Project doesn't have a database or any other complex elements.
* Project uses SwiftUI for the views.
* Project only as dark theme.
* Project Follows clean Architecture.


# Structure has any necessary data or business logic
* "Domain": Files with any necessary data or business logic needed to operate the app
* "Data": Files or classes related to communicating with an external API. This could include code for making HTTP requests to a web server, parsing responses, and handling any errors that may occur.
* "Presentation": The source code files for views and view models.
* "Shared": Files or resources that are shared across multiple parts of the project. Such as utility classes, global constants, or reusable UI elements.

# Deployment
Keep in mind that deploying an iOS app to the App Store requires having an Apple Developer account.

1. Click on the "Product" menu in Xcode and select "Archive." This will create an archive of your project.
2. Once the archive has been created, select it in the Organizer window and click on the "Validate" button to perform some preliminary tests on the app.
3. Once validation is complete, click on the "Distribute" button and select "Ad Hoc" or "App Store" distribution. 
This will create a signed IPA file that can be installed on iOS devices.
4. Follow the prompts in the distribution wizard to complete the distribution process.
5. Once the distribution is complete, you can use the IPA file to install the app on iOS devices
